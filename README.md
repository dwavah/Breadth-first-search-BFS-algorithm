# Breadth-first-search-BFS-algorithm


Imagine you are implementing a social network, use Python to implement a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find mutual friends between two users in the social network represented as a graph. What is your conclusion on the space/time complexity of your method. 


The Conclusion;
The time complexity is O(n + m), where n is the number of vertices(users) and m is the number of edges(friend connections) in the graph. 

The space complexity is O(n) for the visited sets of both BFS traversals and O(n) for the queues.
